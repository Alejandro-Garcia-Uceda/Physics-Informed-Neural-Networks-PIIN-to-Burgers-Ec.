# Physics-Informed-Neural-Networks-PIIN-to-Burgers-Ec.
Develop and implement a PINN to solve the Burguers' Equation. This is the first step in the process of learning how to implement this PINN.

This Notebook is the result of my first approach to the Physical-Informed Neural Network. With this notebook I seek to clarify and consolidate 
the information I have been able to find about this algorithm. For this I have based my work on:
